# EdgeLens
Distributed Deep Learning on FogBus and Aneka - A tutorial. Implement, deploy and test a distributed deep learning software on a Fog Computing setup using FogBus. In this repo we have deployed an object detection YOLO software on multiple edge devices (raspberry pis) and cloud VMs (using Azure).
